"1","Omoide no Marnie","Reno-Rangan","16 June 2015","9/10","From the director Hiromasa Yonebayashi of 'The Secret World of Arriety' fame. Based on the 1967 English novel of the same name and so the important characters borrowed the western names. This is what I call a fine adaptation, great transformation from the words to the motion picture. Actually, it suited for the narration from the standpoint of Japanese culture and lifestyle, especially for this anime version with the beautiful fictional coastal landscapes. Whenever I remember this film in the fu","Some people're destined to meet the secret friend."
"2","Omoide no Marnie","ThomasDrufke","2 February 2016","8/10","One of the many pleasures you have when you watch a Studio Ghibli film is its colorful animation and When Marnie Was There is yet another perfect example of that. More impressively, the story the film tells is just as filled with colorful themes and plot points that you just wouldn't get from a Disney or Dreamworks animated film. When Marnie Was There doesn't pull any punches, but more importantly, the punches they throw at the audience mean something and will have an emotionally resonating impa","Living Life With a Smile"
"3","Omoide no Marnie","ramkoil","13 February 2016","10/10","This Movie touches the human soul at many level. It depicts a child who has been abandoned, by her mother and then grandmother and later partly by her foster-mother, so she feels she can not depend on adults for security. It also shows the value of family and love and affection within the family. Unlike American movies where no one seems to have a family, where the only expression of love is trivial and sexual, here the emotions are deep and adult.The movie elevates us to our higher beings, and ","This is not a Movie Rather an experience"
"4","Omoide no Marnie","k-sky123","16 August 2014","9/10","Have you experienced a feeling like this? The kind of feeling that your sorrow and loneliness nailed you down and you fell into the deep darkness alone, then you stood up, and finds sparks and sparks of lights appeared, leading you to the end of the nightmare, and when came out, you found the sunshine was warmer than ever? This is the movie ""when Marnie was there"".I like this movie. It's a story about two lonely girls, about family and the world, magical but real. As a OCD viewer, my left brain ","Out of the dark"
"5","Omoide no Marnie","CinemaClown","3 July 2015","9/10","The last film to be produced under the Studio Ghibli banner before the acclaimed animation studio decided to take a break from filmmaking following the retirement of Hayao Miyazaki, When Marnie Was There is an elegantly crafted & gorgeously animated tale that intertwines dreams with reality as well as past with present, only to end up getting entangled in its own web.Based on the novel of the same name, When Marnie Was There follows Anna; a 12-year old girl who takes a trip to a countryside town","A Love Story, A Coming-of-Age Drama & A Journey Into One's Own Past"
"6","Omoide no Marnie","planktonrules","27 January 2016","9/10","A while back, I watched a documentary about Hiyao Miyazaki and he sure sounded as if he was saying that after his final film, Studio Ghibli would be no more. Is this true? Not exactly, as this film soon came out...but since then things have been vague and at the very least, the studio is on some sort of hiatus. What's next? Who knows. But does this film give any weight to the argument that Ghibli certainly can go on without him? It did receive an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature....but","Studio Ghibli's last? Who knows....but I wouldn't let young kids watch this one."
"7","Omoide no Marnie","bright-chen97","14 May 2015","10/10","This film has the honour of being the first anime film that I experienced on the big screen.I THINK the moments when I was walking out the door after the movie defined what I felt about the film: I overheard a teenage girl saying: 'Don't know about you, but I never noticed violin music in films before this.' Then she proceeds to hum Anna's theme out loud...note by note.OK, first of all, I don't know what films she has being watching before this, because pretty much every film I watched with a de","A musically driven almost-masterpice."
"8","Omoide no Marnie","Polar-Night","7 May 2015","7/10","I've nearly watched all animations by Studio Ghibli (and many others other than from this studio) and I can with certainty say that this one is the best animated one! It's like a live-action film with great actors :) Every single emotion is magnificently drawn! When you watch this animation, you shouldn't expect a thriller or scenes of action.. the story is widely dramatic and heartbreaking. It has lots of suspenseful moments that make you want to watch it till the end and the ending is really w","It's a Masterpiece!!"

Her foster parents are concerned about her asthma and send her to the country to live with her foster mother's relatives the Oiwas. She finds an abandoned mansion.

"10","Omoide no Marnie","JamesHitchcock","28 September 2017","10/10","Joan G. Robinson's novel ""When Marnie Was There"" is a favourite of mine and has long enjoyed great popularity in Britain, but I was surprised to learn that it is also known in Japan. The original novel is set in a seaside village in Norfolk, but this animated version transfers the action to the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. The characters become Japanese rather than English, although the names of the two main characters, Anna and Marnie, have been retained. Rather oddly, Marnie remains a","Something of Universal Relevance"
