Get it!","Allison .Mace","Love this set. Ordered a L. I'm 5""6, ~155 and a 34DDD.- Have it in army green and black. Probably going to get navy.- Can dress up or down.- Have worn shorts with another top and top with another skirt.- Its linen! Wore it to some hot day concerts and super comfy (Don't mind my to-go bev container haha).- Shorts are high waisted enough that you aren't showing your stomach unless you're really got your hands in the air, waving them like you just to don't care.Also, the Automet shorts style is the best. Ordered another seller to try in different color and wasn't a fan of the shorts. These are more tailored with a side zipper and elastic in back. Way more flattering.

I'm a small/medium in most things, and I got the medium in this and it was so cute! The top's hem came just to the waistline of the shorts and was nice and flowy, and the shorts were perfect and soft. Then I washed it and dried it. Now the top fits like a sports bra, and the shorts look like volleyball shorts. They didn't just shrink a little, they shrunk a lot! They aren't even in a condition that I would feel comfortable donating. So disappointing. Wish I could return or get a refund.

The zipper on the shorts failed on me and it got stuck in the top with the whole side opened.

I really love the shorts and they are super comfortable. My only issue is the zipper is a little weird and doesn’t zip easily at the seam but still works! The shirt isn’t super flattering on me, it makes me feel a bit boxy so I probably won’t wear the set together but I love both pieces (this is more of a me thing lol).

I have long legs so buying shorts before trying them on is always a risk but these were just long enough and fit well.When not compared to the image they provide, the set is actually very cute but I would advise going up a size.","Reviewed in Australia on 26 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I am 5’7, 175, I typically range from a M-L on sizing. I ordered a L in this set because some of the comments suggested it shrunk when drying. I washed mine, dried for a few minutes, then hung to try and it fits perfect!! The shorts are slightly big but super comfortable. I wanted longer shorts to wear in Disney, since I carry a majority of my weight in my legs/lower stomach. THESE WERE PERFECT. I would consider myself someone with larger thighs and the shorts did not ride up or leave me chafed after a full day in Epcot. The material is great and not see through. I was very comfortable all day. Great for anyone looking for something comfy they can move in!","Reviewed in the United States on 7 February 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It is so cute and flattering! I am 5’4” 115lbs and ordered the small for reference. The top is cropped but it shows just a hint of midriff because the shorts are high-waisted enough. It’ll be adorable with flat sandals or a wedge for just about any occasion.

"33","AUTOMET Womens 2 Piece Outfits Lounge Matching Sets Two Piece Linen Shorts Crop Tops 2023 Trendy Clothes Summer Vacation Set","Nice summer outfit","Naomi","I ordered the size that was most appropriate for my thick waist and the set was too big.  There is ample stretchy elastic in the back of the shorts such that they pull on easily and were generously sized at the waist.  The pleats on the front of the shorts are flattering and the top is boxy without being frumpy.  I am 5'5"", DD busty, and about a size 12 right now, and ordered the XL because I didn't want it too tight.  The armholes are way too big, and I need a size or two smaller.  Order your regular size on this.  Cute set!

It would’ve been the perfect size as-is, but I read the reviews about shrinking. So, I ordered the black in a size XL. I’m not at a place in my life (mom of young kids) where I can air dry things 😂 so I knew it would have to adapt to going through the washer and dryer. Not ideal, but I wanted to see if it could hold up.The photos with the black are post-drying. It shrunk to probably a medium! It’s shorter shorts and more cropped than I’d like, but it’s honestly fine.It seems like great quality. The waistband has a lot of give, even with the side zipper.  I’m small busted so the top works well for me.For the price, I’m pleased!","Reviewed in the United States on 25 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I got a M in this and I wish I could have gotten a large in the pants and a small in the top. The top's arm holes are pretty big which means my bra is visible under the arms. The pants (even though they stretch at the back singe) are still a little tight. I'm keeping it because neither of those things are bad enough to send back. The color is GORGEOUS. the material is nice. I would recommend this unless you're a very different size on top/bottom then I think it might be a hard to find the right fit/size.","Reviewed in Canada on 14 July 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I absolutely loved it. I really liked that since it was a 2-piece set I could wear the shirt with different bottoms and the bottoms with a different top. The top is true to size and has a comfortable amount of stretch. The shorts are the reason this didn't get 5 stars. The shorts close with a side zipper and don't have much stretch so it's a little difficult to close; however once you get them closed they are comfortable you just have to yank it a little bit first.","Reviewed in the United States on 10 March 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I first attempted to just zip it up but after I caught my side skin in the zipper I looked at it and held it away from my skin, ouch! had to hold down my breast to see zipper, not do that again. But to unzip it I had to look again to get it down little difficult, little frustrated. Thank goodness I did not have to urgently pee.

"60","AUROLA",NA,"Dianne Page","I've been on the hunt for the ideal pair of gym shorts, and I've finally found them with these women's gym shorts. These shorts have become an essential part of my workout wardrobe, and I can't say enough good things about them.First and foremost, these shorts are incredibly comfortable. The fabric is soft and stretchy, which makes them perfect for all types of workouts, from intense HIIT sessions to yoga and everything in between. They move with me, allowing for a full range of motion without any restrictions.One of the standout features for me is the moisture-wicking technology. I tend to work up a sweat during my workouts, and these shorts do an excellent job of keeping me dry and comfortable. I never have to worry about feeling sticky or uncomfortable, no matter how intense my workout gets.The fit is just right. These shorts are snug enough to stay in place during runs and squats but not so tight that they feel constricting. The waistband is comfortable and doesn't dig in, which is a huge plus. Plus, they come in various lengths and styles, so you can find the perfect fit for your body type and personal preference.I also appreciate the stylish design. These shorts look great both in the gym and for casual wear. The color options are trendy, and the quality is evident. Even after several washes, they still look as good as new.The durability of these shorts is impressive. They have held up well to frequent wear and washing, showing no signs of wear and tear. This longevity is a testament to their quality.In summary, these women's gym shorts are a fantastic addition to any workout wardrobe. They strike the perfect balance between comfort, performance, and style. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for shorts that can keep up with their active lifestyle. These shorts have truly become a game-changer in my fitness routine.","Reviewed in Australia on 23 June 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars",NA

"63","AUROLA","Great Quality and Fit","Emily Knecht","I’ve been looking for a good gym short that is flattering and fits comfortably and this is the best one hands down. The material is thick so you don’t have to worry about anything being see through. There’s no front seam which alleviates the concern about unflattering front appearance. The material is soft and smooth. The detail on the back is flattering and comfortable unlike some shorts I’ve tried that have way too much of a scrunch and the way it’s shaped is uncomfortable. Definitely worth the purchase and I’ve bought many.","Reviewed in Canada on 23 February 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"87","AUROLA","Awesome shorts.","Charlie","These are my favorite shorts that I own for leg workouts. They are very flattering, and the quality is top notch. I have a love-hate relationship with ""butt scrunch"" leggings... what I like about them is the practical aspect. This is going to sound weird lol, but its like each butt cheek is separately secured, so when you do squats, it doesn't feel like there is near as much stress being placed on the center-back seam of the material that goes over your butt. This also means that the material itself stretches less, meaning less chance of the material being see-through.I do NOT like butt scrunch leggings for the ""showing off your butt"" idea. I don't want that kind of attention when I go to the gym. This is precisely why I like these shorts as much as I do. They have the most discreet ""butt scrunch"" that I have tried. Enough to be practical and a little flattering, without giving off ""LOOK AT ME"" vibes. I would still only buy them in black, or a very dark color like navy, because the lighter/brighter colors would still have more of a show-off effect than what I am comfortable with.Some people are complaining about the length of the shorts. Yes, I agree that they are definitely longer than the picture makes them look, but I personally way prefer the biker short length. No rolling up or having to adjust anything mid-exercise.","Reviewed in Canada on 19 February 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"91","AUROLA","Not for thicc girls","TT","I wanted to love these sooo much! I like the feel of the fabric and it does give the glutes a nice lift but the band has a ton of compression and the main part of the bottom really doesn’t so it gave me some crazy hip dips. I have small dips but they’re usually not noticeable in most shorts and these just drew attention to them in the worst way. The uneven compression just caused everything to roll out of place as soon as I started moving. After 1 squat the shorts had given me so many new stomach rolls I could have opened a bakery. If you don’t have much to compress, they’ll probably be fine, if you’re curvy/muscular, you might look for something with more even compression all around.

"142","CRZ YOGA Women's Pima Cotton Workout Crop Top Short Sleeve Running T-Shirt Casual Athletic Tee ","Love it","Athena O'Neil","So if you’re anything like me, you hate returning things, ESPECIALLY if you bought something online. That is why I’m writing this review. I hope it can help someone. So I am 5’6, 175lbs, bust is 38. I got a medium and I’m so glad I did. I was debating on getting the large because on the size chart it said that a size 38 bust would fit better with a large but this is not true. I do not believe that this chart is accurate. It fit well and was not tight or baggy at all. I’ve seen a lot of other reviewers complain about how this shirt is too short, so I was initially very nervous to order because of this. I found that this shirt can be as short as you want it to be. If you wear high waisted leggings, no skin will be shown. If you wear low waisted leggings/pants, your stomach will show, but it is not excessive. It is just like a regular crop top, and it DEFINITELY goes past your bra (I saw a reviewer say that the top wouldn’t go past her bra). Unless you are exceptionally tall this shouldn’t be an issue. Also, if you lift your arms up to the ceiling, this shirt will rise up, but that is to be expected. This is a crop top. This is a GREAT top to wear to the gym and holds sweat very well. I’m overall very pleased with it, and this product has exceeded my expectations.Note: If you are inbetween sizes, stick with your normal size. If you want a tighter fit, size down. If you want a larger fit, size up.","Reviewed in the United States on 8 March 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The set consists a convenient 3/4 zip top and comfortable bottoms featuring an elastic waist and a drawstring.  I must admit the drawstring is more decorative than functional.  The wide leg of the pants is just right—not overly exaggerated but wide enough to provide a stylish and relaxed look.One of the amazing features is the softness of the fabric. I've washed this set three times already, and it still looks and feels as great as it did when I first got it. The color hasn't faded, and there's been no pilling or loss of softness.Being 5'4"" and 142 pounds, I opted for a medium, and it fits me perfectly. The only minor issue I encountered was that the pants were a tad long for my liking. However, a quick fix with hem tape resolved the problem, and now they're just right.  I initially purchased the navy blue set and was so impressed that I bought the apricot color a week later. I'm pleased to report that both colors are true to what's shown online.  The outfit is incredibly soft, and in my opinion, it's an excellent dupe for high-end brands.","Reviewed in the United States on 9 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Fabric feel is about same weight, it is very smooth but doesn't feel quite as luxurious to me.  Sizing/fit is interesting. The top feels gigantic for most part and the sleeves outrageously long. well past my finger tips. but the waist band feels tight and with less stretch. The matching pants are snug. the AE are ordered as separates and I probably would have sized up in the pants. they fit, but the look isn't super flattering due to the snugness particularly in the color I got.Speaking of, that was one of the things I loved was the color choices. the pink I got is definitely lovely.

Medium fits well and maybe even a smidge big. The pants, however, are long on me despite others saying they aren't long. I'm 5'4"" (that's generous) so I knew there was a risk. They also had a weird smell out of the package... I'm sensitive to smells so maybe it's just me? I washed them and hope this isn't a problem.","Reviewed in the United States on 8 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Material feels like that type that you can find in some athletic jackets...smooth & kind of slippery. It's not too thick and overall a soft comfy material. The thick high waisted band (about 2"") is a tighter elastic....it stretches, but it keeps everything in place. If you like the snatched-in look & feel you'll like it a lot. It has a drawstring that is stretchy and the aglet caps are metal which is nice. The zipper for the top is plastic...nothing fancy, but it does the job. I like that you can zip it all the way up to make it a loose mock turtleneck if you want. There is a small slit on each wrist cuff...not sure if this is so the wristband isn't too tight or it's suppose to be some kind of faux thumb hole lol. The arm & ankle lengths were just perfect.  I love the wide leg pants....not too wide & it falls nicely without bunching. I'm 5'7"" & ordered a medium....I think my measurements were in between med-large. I might order a large next time to see how it fits only because I like my waist band to fit looser (my waist is 33"").  Overall, I'm sure I'll wear this one lots as it's getting cooler outside.

In the photo, the dark cyan is a very dark teal.; but it is borderline electric blue in real life. It’s pretty, but it’s not a color I would choose to wear.Also, the scrunch on the butt is very dramatic. If that’s your thing, it’s really cute. If it’s not your thing, then stay away. I usually like a subtle scrunch so this shocked me at first to try on but I will admit that it grew on me…. I’ll just have to be brave enough to wear them because it draws a lot of attention to your butt!The sizing also surprised me. I usually wear an XS or smaller in bottoms. My waist is 22-23 inches and my hips are only about 34 inches so usually most clothes are too big on me but I sized up to a S and they are quite tight (but In a flattering way since they’re stretchy).

I had really high hopes for these shorts after seeing countless amazing reviews! Unfortunately, these did not sit right on my shape. They were too snug around my thighs and gaped slightly at the waist which made them slide down making them sit awkward on my shape. I could not go down a size as they would be too tight around my thighs and going a size up would make it even more loose around my waist… I am 5’7” and an AU size 8 for reference (more like an AU size 6 waist and AU size 10 hips).

They’re so comfortable they’re probably one of my top two pairs of workout shorts. The one thing I didnt like was the front seam has a tiny bit too much fabric and it puffs a bit which is mildly unflattering. But it’s not super noticeable, and the pros of these shorts outweigh that one con that I’m keeping these and wear them constantly. I did have to size up from a medium to a large to get the baggier/more relaxed look I was hoping for. There’s also a zippered pocket. Overall the quality of these is just so good. Even the sewn in undies are comfortable and I have always had to cut them out of my lululemon shorts. Can’t say enough good about this brand! Everything I buy keeps me excited and in love.

Not really, but it feels like it!My legs are by far the area I am most self conscious about so I’m very particular. I wanted to love the BMJL shorts that has so many reviews, but alas, it was not meant to be! They are comfy, but I didn’t love them. I would be settling. The medium fit my thighs but pinched the muffin! The large fit nicely on my hips, but the thigh holes were so big it added bulkiness…if there’s one thing I do not need, it’s bulkiness.Enter CRZ Yoga! I have several of their leggings and they are amazing!! I also have several sports bras and tank tops that I have had for YEARS and they are still in pretty good shape. That’s impressive since I workout 5 days a week! I have tried their shorts before (5 in inseam) and they were good, but the material was heavy (does that make sense), and I didn’t know that until I tried these. Also, the large in the older version was a tad bigger, but these fit like a dream! No muffin! Thigh holes are perfect (my thighs are 23 in around at the largest part)! The material is lightweight and quick drying. These are 3 in inseam, but I also have the 4 in inseam and you can hardly tell the difference. I like both a lot. My only complaint is they go fast, even on their website.Let me summarize this way, I got a color other than black or navy. That’s a huge win for me!

I’m 5’8” and don’t like really short shorts because I have this permanent hematoma on my upper outer thigh that I’m self conscious of and also don’t like it when short athletic shorts look like underwear when you sit down because they ride up. These still ride up when sitting but not nearly as much as others.The stretch is perfect. Enough to suck my tummy in some but not enough to feel uncomfortable on my abdomen. I have chronic GI pain that’s exacerbated by too tight of clothing. These don’t cause me issues! The built in undies fit almost perfectly. Sometimes the built ins are too small and cut into me but these are great.My only con is the pocket. I bought these shorts mainly because it has a pocket. I bought a pair of athletic shorts years ago with pockets and now I can never go back to no pockets! The 1 pocket on these does not fit my iPhone 10. I can stuff it in there but 1/3 of the phone sticks out so you definitely wouldn’t be able to run with your phone in there. It’s good for keys and a small travel pill container. If the pocket was slightly bigger then these would be a 10/10.Overall, these may be my favorite or in the top 2 favorite gym shorts that I own. I will probably buy more colors unless I can find others with better pockets.

"340","Gihuo Women's Athletic Full Zip Lightweight Workout Jacket with Thumb","Different Sellers","Damaris","BLACK SWEATER - ⭐️⭐️⭐️ I know it's cheap, but for $20 I could've gotten something really nice off of Old Navy. The material is extremely thin, and the finishing is terrible - loose threads, bad stitching etc. Also, the zipper is cheap and whoever sewed it didn't do it well enough because the fabric tends to create an odd buldge around my midriff that I can't press down. On another note, the fit is a bit off. I made sure to measure myself before buying but it is still too tight, and going up a size would make it too big for me. I have a somewhat long torso and this sweater tends to ride up a bit bc it is too cropped.WHITE SWEATER - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️obviously there are different sellers on this one Amazon post bc the white sweater is so much nicer than the black one. It has the perfect thickness for an exercise/lightweight jacket, the stitching is neat and the fit is absolutely perfect. The zipper is of good quality and there is no bunching along it. The feel of the material is also wonderful. The only downside is that it is a tad see through if you don't wear a black sports bra or t-shirt underneath.

I would definitely recommend it for those with more “proportional” whatever that means, bodies.","Reviewed in Canada on 12 February 2024","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"402","THE GYM PEOPLE Womens High Waisted Running Shorts Quick Dry Athletic Workout Shorts with Mesh Liner Zipper Pockets","Awesome and secure- a great dupe!","Sarah S","Detailed review ahead (girl, be ready for a novel)….I have to say first that I am a die hard lululemon fan, but I work as a choreographer every summer for a well respected theatre camp. Last year, all my lululemon running shorts and most of my tanks were on their last leg. I had heard about these online and wanted to give them a try as an alternative for summer camp, as I could spend less and buy more colors to mix and match. WOW! For the money you can’t go wrong.I purchased the white, black, denim blue, and jade green tanks and the matching mesh lined high waist running shorts. I am 5’7 and your typical smedium 32dd. I ordered medium across the board. I rapidly lose weight over the summer due to the heat and the exercise. I feel these will fit me if I fluctuate as low as about 15 pounds lighter.Tanks- These are fantastic. They are not for super high impact, but for lower/ medium impact dance they are great. I can also see myself wearing these all summer as loungewear or with shorts. If I sized down it would’ve given me more cleavage than I wanted.  I may try taking in the liner a bit for more security near the end of summer when I’ve dropped weight. Great lululemon dupe. Comfortable and flattering. The ONLY con I have is that the size varied slightly by color. The black and white fit more snug (which I preferred). The denim blue and Jade green fit a little looser as you can see in the side profile picture of the denim blue set.Shorts- these are great dupes as well! The back pocket completely fits my iPhone XR. The side pocket is super secure and deep. The shorts are slightly longer in the back. The high waist is pretty small and includes about an inch of tighter elastic. I personally like this for camp so my walkie doesn’t pull them down, but if you have more of a square figure it may pay to size up. The tank meets right where these shorts start. My only complaint on these is sometimes the way they lay can look a bit funky in the crotch area, but nothing too major. The colors all looked great. I wore the white with red underwear and it didn’t show through where the mesh liner was.As a set- Black is perfect and what you’d expect. The white is a CRISP white. Like, it made me pull out my teeth whitener white. It’s beautiful, but literally my Snow White OPI nail polish even looked a tad dingy in comparison. The Jade green shorts were a slightly different shade than the tank. It was not enough for my husband to notice without telling him. For some reason it looks a lot different in the photo but they’re more similar in person. The blue is a pretty darn close match. If anything, the band is slightly different due to the different material. It’s not a dealbreaker for me, as I plan to mix and match a lotFinal thoughts- I love them. I sent both my sisters the links to them, I will live in them all summer, and I will be buying more sets in a variety of colors.

"403","THE GYM PEOPLE Womens High Waisted Running Shorts Quick Dry Athletic Workout Shorts with Mesh Liner Zipper Pockets","I ordered a second pair the first day I wore these!","Sarah S","I bought these shorts for running. I got tired of my bike shorts riding up into unmentionable places while running and hiking! ;)Pros: Super comfortable. 2 pockets that work for keys and phone, the larger back pocket zips to keep your phone snug and safe. On point sizing. Stays exactly where they start, with nice loose legs for freedom of movement. Which brings me to my first con..Cons: Not a huge fan of the mesh attached underwear. Due to that I cut the mesh undies out, and found out that minus them, they do ride up a bit. They still give you decent coverage, but they didn't stay in place as much without them. I had to tug them down a few times over my 3 mile run. So. If you don't like the mesh briefs, just know that cutting them out means they don't stay out the same way. Also, the ruffle below the back waistband is a bit weird. It looks really flattering if you are wearing a crop or belly button length tank. It's not bulky under a longer or looser shirt, but..why? I don't really get the concept. I do miss side pockets a bit in these, but there IS pockets available for the necessities. So that might be picky on my part!Overall? I ordered more the first day I wore them, because they are cute and comfy! I got a ton of compliments and pointed a fellow yoga lover to them because the matching mesh briefs mean all the cheeks and bits stay decent. Even during a handstand!

"404","THE GYM PEOPLE Womens High Waisted Running Shorts Quick Dry Athletic Workout Shorts with Mesh Liner Zipper Pockets","The liner is looser and these are SHORT","quickcat","I am 5'2"", 140lbs generally a Large bottom. Got these in Medium Wine Red based on reviews and intending to wear them high waisted. They do feel a bit tight around my waist (34in), and they are SHORT worn like this... I cannot imagine a taller person or long legs!! Worn high-waisted these have about a 2in inseam, and it rolls up sometimes when I've been active a while which is really annoying.The back pocket is roomy for my phone (Samsung s10) to have a snug fit and doesn't feel like it flops around when I'm active. The front pocket is on the left side and suitable for a house key or room card or lip balm or something small.The mesh is light and these are light wicking. The liner is loose.... like quite loose. If I had a Large, I would have been swimming in it. So not great if you don't want to wear undies with these!The fabric is a sporty, lightweight fabric as expected and food for watersport as well as an alternative to swim bottoms. If they get wet (red wine color) it's noticeable from sweat or other liquids. The waist band is a softer stretch fabric and feels nice against the skin and nonchafing.These are very well made and high quality shorts. The color is a true wine red and very pretty.","Reviewed in the United States on 18 June 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Compared to other notable athletic brands, i think these are high quality for the price. The pictures aren't great to show the fit, but i wanted to show how vibrant the pink is. I LOOOOVE the color. I bought two different pairs both pink, but different shades of pink. This is the ""Bright Pink"" color. The other pair was ""Rose Red"". As some have mentioned, the waistband is pretty tight fitting. I dont mind it, but when I'm just wearing the shorts and my sports bra, it definitely cinches in at my waist, with just the slightest bit of skin bulging over. (the worlds tiniest muffin top) It doesn't bother me enough to not wear them. The other thing that makes the fit a little weird, is that while the waist is tight, the built in briefs are pretty dang loose. And i am not a pancake booty. I have some buns, and the briefs are loose on me. It causes the material where the shorts meet the waistband to give just a little puff thats not the most flattering. I'd rather it lay flatter than poofing out. Anyway, this could all be different with one size up. I'm 5'4"" 127lbs and bought size small. Maybe a medium would eliminate the issues, but c'est la vie.

The fabric is not as soft as LuLu (of course) but still acceptable for a cheap version which I would take traveling abroad. As you can see in the picture, there is some puffiness where the flowy part of the short start which is not bad if you wear a shirt that hits that seam. What did it for me and why I am returning them is, the liner is SUPER BAGGY, to the point that I can fit 3 fingers width between the fabric and my leg = what is the point of it?","Reviewed in the United States on 5 September 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"438","THE GYM PEOPLE Womens High Waisted Running Shorts Quick Dry Athletic Workout Shorts with Mesh Liner Zipper Pockets","High quality, true to size","LM","I loved these so much I had to write a review.  I first purchased the pink shorts pictured above in medium because some reviewers said that these shorts ran small and since I wouldn't have time to exchange before an upcoming race I couldn't take a chance on them being too small.  They were a little billowy, but I kept them and loved the back pocket, which held my phone securely and the front pocket is great for a hotel key card or credit card.  I have washed and dried them and they seem very well made.  So I had to get another pair.  This time I got a size small, which is what I usually wear in most brands.  I also got a matching top in medium because I don't like to feel constricted.  I am 5-8 and 135 pounds, and athletic build.  I hope this helps people determine their size.  The top is also well made and the perfect length for me.  At 58 years old, I kind of like my crop tops a little longer.  ; )","Reviewed in the United States on 10 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It has a zippered pocket in the back to store essentials and the backside is a bit longer to cover her ample derrière. But… she says the back is maybe a bit too long. Noticeably longer than the front. I asked if it’s because her legs are short. So I am getting comfortable on the couch as I write this review.

Aside from that I love the material and I love that the scrunch in the back isn't super obvious like other brands. There is a downside to the scrunch and that would be that it's almost reflective.

I am 5’5”, 135 and normally order a small in leggings for the compression and a medium in shorts so I would say these are true to size.","Reviewed in the United States on 31 December 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I can't recommend them highly enough. They have such cute colors and a lot of variety.My only complaint is the waist band is a tad high for me and i usually fold it down. But i don't mind doing that, and I would rather fold it down than have it be too low.

But they’re still very comfortable and work great for casual wear.I ordered two more pairs in different colors (black and royal blue), but the same size as the red ones. They definitely do NOT fit the same. The blue pair has a much smaller waist and are also tighter in the legs. The black pair fits the same in the waist as my red pair, but the legs are definitely tighter. I’m going to keep them because they do stretch some and they’re still fine for lounging.

They all shipped separately. The first pair to arrive was Black (size medium). They fit fine, but the mesh was somewhat stiff. The second pair was a French Blue (size medium) and these are MUCH shorter and WAY TIGHTER than the black ones - that is because they are *not the same style of shorts* whatsoever. The third pair was a Cornflower Blue, but I canceled those because the first two pairs were blah (the first was stiff, the second was too small - and these are *supposed to be* the same Style and the same Fit, just different colors).My original review was: these shorts are not as soft as the older style of Champion shorts.","Reviewed in the United States on 9 August 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I think these fit the bill. They are also loose enough to move without being baggy.They are reversible, but I doubt I'll reverse them much. The inner color shows the white Champion waistband and the bottom hem is the opposite color. The inner color is a solid fabric, where the outer is the mesh with little holes. My only ""complaint"" is that the hula blue is really more purple than blue. Still, it's very attractive and will work fine with my t-shirts.

All of the shorts run a little larger than a typical women's large size would run but it's not so much larger that I would need to order a medium (-a medium would be to snug for me but I like to wear my workout clothes loose not tight). If you are a person who likes to wear your clothes a bit snug and you usually wear a large, I think you would probably be happy with a medium.","Reviewed in the United States on 24 April 2014","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I purchased the white, and purposefully checked to make sure they were lined.  According to the description, they were.  When the shorts arrived, the fit was good - maybe a bit on the large size.  The color is nice, waistband is comfortable.  As for the lining that they were supposed to have, they DO have a see thru piece of material attached, but I would hardly call it a lining.  Had I purchased any other color, it probably wouldn't have been a problem.

"601","G Gradual Women's High Waisted 9","Best Everyday and Travel Shorts Ever","Karen","What’s not to like?These shorts are incredibly comfortable, light (not see through), and soft. They seem to be made of a stretchy, lightweight, swimsuit fabric. So, they’ll dry quickly. They’re definitely not too tight. The longer length is great for hiking, running errands, casual events and just hanging around the house. I live in Arizona where it’s HOT and these shorts are comfortable outside.Cons:—Not quite 9 inches long if you’re looking for that exact length (It doesn’t matter to me in the slightest.)—Doesn’t provide any compression (Again, that’s not an issue for me.)—Pockets are on the sides of my hips which renders them useless for me (I don’t need to draw attention to my hips.)Pros:—Comfortable, lightweight and soft—More modest than most shorts—Very packable—Easily hand washed and quickly dried on trips—AttractiveI’ll be ordering more of these!!!!","Reviewed in the United States on 17 August 2023","4.5 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

But after receiving it, it has no shape, the material does not feel nice, and the sleeves are too short and too baggy.

"670","Hanes Women's Sport Cool Dri Performance Long Sleeve Tee","Great layering piece, even better price!","Alejandra","I was looking for long sleeved neutral shirts to layer in the winter. Stumbled across these and figured it was worth a try for the price! Very happy with the product, it's exactly what I was looking for. Super light weight, would probably be great in spring or summer. These shirts are great under bigger jackets etc in the winter. Some of the reviews I read almost led me to purchase an XS but I stuck with Small and am happy with the fit, don't think I will dry them though. Would order again in M for more length over the bum. For reference I am 5'5 and 135 lbs.The white is definitely sheer because the fabric is quite light weight. You could see my black bra underneath but i think it looks fine with a bright sports bra underneath or if you went with nude or white I don't think it would show much.","Reviewed in Canada on 10 December 2020","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"693","Hanes Women's Sport Cool Dri Performance Long Sleeve Tee","It fit, but it's a little cheap compared to others","CSC","I needed several long-sleeve white tshirts, so I bought this shirt and a similar long-sleeve white t-shirt from Cadmus here on Amazon. I wear a lot of Hanes products for casual wear, but the Cadmus looked good too, so I bought one of each. At the time, they were both about $15. However, I was really disappointed in the Hanes shirt.This shirt was light/thin and felt cheap, probably due to it's fabric. This shirt is 100% polyester, while other athletic shirts are composed of polyester and spandex. Without spandex, this shirt doesn't move or flex as easily. Also, spandex gives fabric a smoother, silkier, and thicker/heavier feel that this shirt lacks.Although it says it's for athletics, I feel like the cut and fit of this shirt are more fashion-oriented. However, even for that, I did not keep the shirt, because it didn't look nearly as good on me as the Cadmus shirt.I notice that the price on this shirt has now dropped to $10, but I think even at that price, I probably wouldn't have kept the shirt.","Reviewed in the United States on 30 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I need a long sleeve shirt to wear when hiking in hot weather, and this fits the bill. It's comfortable. However, you get what you pay for. The finish of the shirt is substandard at seams, but I haven't had it long enough to see how it holds up. As others have noted, because it's lightweight, undergarments may show through (I bought white). This is not an issue for my purposes.

"761","BMJL Women's Running Shorts Elastic High Waisted Shorts Pocket Sporty Workout Shorts Quick Dry Athletic Shorts Pants","Lightweight, airy, comfortable, great for summertime!","Samantha","These shorts have become my summertime staple. They are lightweight, moisture wicking, quick drying, and overall comfortable. I am 5'6.5"" and 147 lbs and I now have the black and the grey in medium, which is my usual size. They have built in underwear which is very comfortable too. My favorite part is that they have pockets and my phone fits very well in them so if I take my dog for a jog, the phone won't come out. The waistband is snug but not uncomfortable, and leaves an imprint on my stomach from the fabric but I don't mind it. I appreciate the high waisted look and it comes to right under my bellybutton. I found these to be somewhat similar to a pair I bought from Old Navy but these are more affordable. Hope this helps!","Reviewed in the United States on 2 August 2022","4.4 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The pocket has ample room to put your phone in as well as keys, etc.  I like that it zips up so you don’t have to worry about your stuff falling out while you’re working out. The fabric of the short is slightly stretchy and very breathable. The built-in underwear are wonderful because they keep the short from riding up or moving around while you exercise. They are very comfortable too. The high waist is figure flattering and very comfortable. The short is a very good quality and I would absolutely buy another pair.","Reviewed in the United States on 29 December 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"861","BMJL Women's Athletic Shorts High Waisted Running Shorts Pocket Sporty Shorts Gym Elastic Workout Shorts","LOVE","Ashley","I’m usually pretty hesitant to buy shorts online because they’re either too small, too short, too sheer, or too low waisted. These shorts are absolutely perfect!I’m 5’8, about 36” waist, and typically a 12/14 in bottoms. I ordered an XL just to be safe and I definitely think that was the right choice. Any smaller would’ve been too tight for my liking.The material is thin and light but doesn’t look cheap. I love how they’re slightly longer in the back and curve up on the sides. The waistband really snatches you in without being uncomfortable or restricting. The liner inside is also thin but softer than the material of the shorts so if you wanted to go ~natural~ you’d be cozy.There is one zip pocket on the left side and it fits my IPhone XR perfectly with a little extra room.

"872","BMJL Women's Athletic Shorts High Waisted Running Shorts Pocket Sporty Shorts Gym Elastic Workout Shorts","Not too bad!","Michele","I can understand if my review title isn’t convincing, but I’ll explain. I’m someone who reads a lot of reviews before I commit, and there were some mixed ones on this item. I wanted a pair of athletic shorts that didn’t cost me $50+ and were high-waisted, so I tried these. The material is lightweight, moisture-wicking, and has decent stretch in it. I personally LOVE the seat coverage of the built-in brief. Too often, shorts with a brief liner ride up when you move and these cover like a full-coverage bottom, so no wedgie worry! Win. Some reviews said the back was too long - I disagree. I have longer legs than torso and a rounder bottom, so I loved the back length. Where I’m a little bummed.. The shorts do ride up in the front, and they will if you have a more quad-dominant leg. Because they’re a nice, longer length with a more flat front (to be more flattering, no doubt!), there’s nowhere else for the fabric to go once you start moving and walking. If I wanted to wear these shorts for a casual, athleisure outfit, the ride wouldbother me because I’d have to keep pulling them down. Since I plan to work out in them, run, play volleyball, I guess I won’t have to tug them up in front? I am 5’7, 160lbs, and I ordered a medium based on the size chart measurements. I feel this is the most appropriate size, as a L would have been too “balloon-y”. So overall, they’re not too bad! I will probably get other pairs to rotate, just wish that the front didn’t “pooch” out as much.","Reviewed in the United States on 4 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I’m 5’7” 145 lbs (usually a S in shorts/bottoms) and i sized up to a M hoping the liner wouldn’t dig in when I run. It’s so insanely comfortable. The liner is more of a brief fit and is the softest material. That’s the only main concern I’ve ever had with lululemon, Nike, etc. my only complaints with these shorts are that the material of the actual short part are super thin paper like. It feels sweat wicking but I could still see sweat marks on them. The band is also super thick and is also made of that same sweat wicking material so it isn’t the most comfortable for long runs. Had the band been made of the liner material these would be the holy grail!!

I’ve been looking for a set of workout shorts for a while that weren’t bike shorts and don’t ride up the butt and these for the bill! I love the modern style of the high and thick waistband too. I’m in my 40’s and love the look of cropped, loose work out tanks but don’t want to show my stomach. Since these have a high waist I can wear crop tops without showing my stomach and the thick waistband makes it look so cute! I’ve walked 3+ miles in them and used them for barre classes and they feel great. The material dries fast and even though they come very wrinkled, just give them a steam and they’re good to go. While wearing I don’t find they wrinkle easy either. I bought so many colors. I got my typical size in bottoms (medium), I’ve got a big butt and muscular thighs.

But after receiving it, it has no shape, the material does not feel nice, and the sleeves are too short and too baggy.

"1071","Hanes Women's Sport Cool Dri Performance Long Sleeve Tee","Great layering piece, even better price!","Avery Clay","I was looking for long sleeved neutral shirts to layer in the winter. Stumbled across these and figured it was worth a try for the price! Very happy with the product, it's exactly what I was looking for. Super light weight, would probably be great in spring or summer. These shirts are great under bigger jackets etc in the winter. Some of the reviews I read almost led me to purchase an XS but I stuck with Small and am happy with the fit, don't think I will dry them though. Would order again in M for more length over the bum. For reference I am 5'5 and 135 lbs.The white is definitely sheer because the fabric is quite light weight. You could see my black bra underneath but i think it looks fine with a bright sports bra underneath or if you went with nude or white I don't think it would show much.","Reviewed in Canada on 10 December 2020","4.3 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1095","Hanes Women's Sport Cool Dri Performance Long Sleeve Tee","It fit, but it's a little cheap compared to others","CSC","I needed several long-sleeve white tshirts, so I bought this shirt and a similar long-sleeve white t-shirt from Cadmus here on Amazon. I wear a lot of Hanes products for casual wear, but the Cadmus looked good too, so I bought one of each. At the time, they were both about $15. However, I was really disappointed in the Hanes shirt.This shirt was light/thin and felt cheap, probably due to it's fabric. This shirt is 100% polyester, while other athletic shirts are composed of polyester and spandex. Without spandex, this shirt doesn't move or flex as easily. Also, spandex gives fabric a smoother, silkier, and thicker/heavier feel that this shirt lacks.Although it says it's for athletics, I feel like the cut and fit of this shirt are more fashion-oriented. However, even for that, I did not keep the shirt, because it didn't look nearly as good on me as the Cadmus shirt.I notice that the price on this shirt has now dropped to $10, but I think even at that price, I probably wouldn't have kept the shirt.","Reviewed in the United States on 30 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The finish of the shirt is substandard at seams, but I haven't had it long enough to see how it holds up. As others have noted, because it's lightweight, undergarments may show through (I bought white). This is not an issue for my purposes.

The UPF 50+ rating is what initially drew me to this shirt, and it didn’t disappoint. It provided excellent protection from the sun without having to constantly reapply sunscreen, especially in hard-to-reach areas.The material is lightweight and breathable, which is a huge plus for outdoor activities. Despite its long sleeves, I didn’t feel overheated even under direct sunlight. The moisture-wicking property of the fabric kept me dry and comfortable throughout my hikes.What I also love about this shirt is its versatility. It’s not just for hiking; I’ve worn it for fishing trips and casual outdoor outings, and it fits in perfectly in each setting. The fit is flattering yet not restrictive, offering a good balance between comfort and style.The durability of the shirt after several washes is impressive. It has retained its shape, color, and most importantly, its sun protection capability.In terms of design, it’s a nice break from the typical rugged outdoor wear. The shirt comes in various colors, providing options for those who like to add a bit of style to their outdoor gear.In conclusion, the Bassdash Women’s UPF 50+ UV Sun Protection T-Shirt is an excellent choice for anyone looking for a functional, comfortable, and stylish piece of outdoor clothing. Whether you’re into hiking, fishing, or just need a good sun-protective shirt for everyday use, this one ticks all the boxes.

"1113","HBassdash Women’s UPF 50+ UV Sun Protection T-Shirt Long Sleeve Fishing Hiking Performance Shirts","Great for sun protection","K jones","I love this shirt and will probably order another. You can’t beat the price. It’s for exactly what it say, UV/ sun protection when outdoors on the water. I use it mostly as a cover up from the bright sun when stand up paddle boarding. It is so light weight that I don’t get hot even in the peak midday heat. It dries really quickly due to the light weight and fabric. I think the sizing is exactly right. I typically fit a M or L and tried both. I ended up wanting a little looser fit for my purposes so I kept the L but the M fit fine. Sleeves are very long which is great for me. Could be too long for shorties. Keep in mind that it’s not a rash guard and is not meant to fit skin tight or provide the protection of one when surfing.

Second order neck smaller and fit higher up/tighter. Third order loose and sloppy around the neck. The overall fit of these shirts are pretty boxy and unflattering in my opinion. I wouldn't wear them as just a shirt. They are however pretty good as an undershirt, especially for under scrubs which is what I use them for. They are moisture wick, comfortable, and my scrubs slide easily with the material, no sticking or static. Inexpensive enough to replace easily when the white turns discolored from wear.

I have purchased this shirt 3 times. First picture is from 2020, second picture is from 2022, and third picture is from July 2023. The first shirt was perfect. It fit right, was actually tagless like the picture shows in the listing, and the quality was good. The second shirt was okay. The fit was fine, not tagless anymore, and the quality was starting to decline. As you can see in the second picture, it's starting to get less opaque. The third and most recent shirt looks awful. The fit in the chest is tighter as well as the sleeves and the neck is wider. Again, it's not tagless anymore and the quality is abysmal. It's practically see through. I wouldn't even risk buying any of the lighter colored shirts. In the last picture, you can see the differences in color and fit. You can clearly see the third shirt is narrower at the chest, boxier looking, and has a wider neck. I regret not purchasing more in 2020.

I'm tall also (5'10"") so I like a shirt that comes down past my waist to fall at just above hip level, and this shirt length is perfect.  Considering the cost, I though the fabric would be thin, flimsy and prone to snags.  NOT!  The fabric has a very nice body to it, I've worn and laundered it at least a dozen times and it still looks as nice as the day I got it.

"1199","Hanes Sport Women's Short Sleeve Cool DRI Performance Tee","Polyester shirts, a little stretchy: wash and dry no special instructions","Gertrude","I bought two of these shirts, an XL light blue and later, a L navy. Following the size chart, I ordered the XL. It fits loosely, the neck is high up as shown in the model. But because of the thin material and the light color, I didn't think this shirt was the most flattering. It's fine, don't get me wrong - it isn't the fault of the shirt that any pants or wiggle/jiggles are extra visible with the light blue color. It is still fine for working out or for around the house. This also stains easily.I then ordered a darker Navy in L. This one is form fitting and because it is darker, the muffin top is less noticeable and in my opinion more flattering for hourglass figures.The material, 100% polyester, does well in the washer and dryer - very few wrinkles. Both shirts are nicely constructed in and out (it says made in Jordan). This shirt is especially good for travel when you need to pack light as this shirt can be washed, and dried overnight and does not wrinkle. It is easy, casual wear over jeans or leggings.Another Hanes shirt I really like that are 100% cotton with a more feminine fit is the

"1200","Hanes Sport Women's Short Sleeve Cool DRI Performance Tee","Good tee fit and true to size for a busty person","CW","I wasn’t sure about the size since mine fluctuates and I’m currently on the large end. I wanted wicking shirts that fit like my favorite tee, with just a little bit of draping. I prefer to buy once cry once with merino wool and do have some of those tees but they’re always cut for a certain athletic build, either very narrow for the men’s and I have to size up and have giant sleeves, or they just don’t come in my size in women’s. I got this Hanes shirt in a 2X and worried it would run small but it is perfect and very comfortable and cool. I hate sweaty cotton clinging to me and these will be a nice swap out with my basic tees for summer days when I’m outside, on dog walks, etc. I plan to get one a size down for a beach trip as a swim shirt and rash guard  for boogie boarding under that brutal Atlantic sun.","Reviewed in the United States on 15 June 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Sometimes as a plus-sized person it's not always easy to find nice looking, comfortable clothing that's great for those on a tight budget.  These fit the bill so well and I love them!

The pockets are a bonus, as they are large enough to comfortably fit a phone into and not fear it falling out. I usually err on the side of ordering larger than I think I need because I am apple/pear shaped; however, the shorts ended up being a tad large on me.

The pockets are roomy, which I think is a big plus since womens shorts and pants often have tiny pockets. They're pretty casual as far as the material is concerned, but I actually dressed them up a little more with a nicer top and some cute sandals.

The fabric goes with so many fabrications. Great length. Doesn't expose anything you want to keep discreet. No itching, riding up, bunching, or wrinkling. Rest assured when crossing your legs, one over the other or in a pointed angle at the knee. I bought 2 colors. I'm going back for 2 more.

They're not too thick, not too thin, they wash well and they're super comfy. I live in shorts and tanks all summer and these are great for quick walks, grocery shopping or scrubbing your toilet....whatever the day throws at you. I don't expect them to last for years and years, but at this price point they don't need to.

"1275","icyzone Workout Running Tshirts for Women - Fitness Athletic Yoga Tops Exercise Gym Shirts","Fit as expected","Kimberly M.","At 5'3"" & 140 lbs, I'm so glad I ordered a small & ignored some of these reviews without pictures. I don't like huge shirts when I'm working out because they get in my way. It's fitted, but doesn't cling tightly & it's actually not near as small as some of the other athletic shirts I own that are a size small or medium. The material is moisture wicking & dries pretty quickly. The sleeves aren't too tight, which is a problem I sometimes run into. I usually buy athletic tops in smalls or mediums, so I suggest buying your normal athletic top size as everyone carries their weight differently. I now own this shirt in 5 colors.","Reviewed in the United States on 10 July 2022","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It hasn’t stopped me wearing them but I’m conscious that I need to pull the top down into place every so often as I end up with huge gap around my neck. It had it occurred to me that this would be a problem and to be honest I will continue to use as I feel they are comfortable and flexible and ideal for the gym.

The material has good body and hand feel.The length is long covering my entire rear and would go well over plainer leggings or yoga pants.Size XL - (each size has their own sleeve and shirt length) My bust measurement is at the upper limits on size chart 38C and broad shoulders but the shoulder seam is sitting naturally all the way out to the edge and beyond.This shirt fits clingy while feeling lighter than air on and would make a good winter layer underneath things in northern climates. There is no drape at all in the shirt, it is meant to be clingy imo or size up 1 size and defeat the 5% spandex.Colors depicted on listing are a bit off due to sheen and Heather effect, the lavender is more wine color and the peach is more light and intense melon color.For activities this is comfortable and not tight feeling but the shirt does show everything about your body contours (at my age) and the 2 lighter colors make it more obvious.","Reviewed in the United States on 11 August 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The material is not see through, the fabric is soft, but the shirt is pretty thin and does not hide much. If you want to go out in public in this shirt, you would need to wear some pasties or a bralette unless you want everyone to see your nipples. The sleeves are good a long, the thumb holes are comfortable and the sleeves end a little past my knuckles. My shoulders are more broad than the typical t-shirt and this shirt fits perfectly.

"1417","Muzniuer Women's Long Sleeve Open Back Shirts Loose Backless Yoga Shirts Thumbhole Shirts","Comfortable for yoga & nice enough to wear out on the town!","Katie","I had a shirt like this from a popular ""fast fashion"" store & lost it on a vacation. I wore the style often so took to Amazon to try to find a replacement. I ordered the Black color in size Medium. I love, love love, this shirt & it's much nicer than the shirt I bought it to replace! It's super soft & the fabric has a nice mid-weight that feels like good-quality workout/lounge pieces from much more expensive stores. It's slightly slinky & stretchy, but drapes flatteringly. I much prefer it to the original shirt I lost & will order it in more colors.I am 5'8'', 135 lbs, size B bra, athletic build. I'm usually in between a Small & a Medium in most popular store sizes. I would say the Medium for this shirt runs on the larger side of Medium. If I wanted a tighter fit I would size down to a small, but I personally like the looser drapey fit of the medium. The sleeves are generously long & have nice comfortable fitting thumb holes. The length of the shirt is nice as well. I have a long torso & it looks good sitting higher on my waist with jeans and lower with leggings. After wearing the shirt all day I haven't noticed any snagging or pilling. I paired it with a strappy back sports bra & wore it to a yoga class & then afterwards to get a drink with a friend. She complimented my new purchase & was amazed when I told her where I got it & for how much!","Reviewed in the United States on 16 November 2019","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1450","Muzniuer Women's Long Sleeve Open Back Shirts Loose Backless Yoga Shirts Thumbhole Shirts","Very Weird Fit, Not Meant for Lounging or Working Out","Karen","I really wanted to like this shirt! It has the open back and the thumb hole, and isn't the worst material. The fit is absolutely terrible, though. The sleeves from the thumb are way too long. It covers my pinky finger entirely. I'm on the shorter side, have pretty long fingers, and like a long sleeve. But this at least an inch or two longer than any other shirt of this kind.The stitching in the shoulder is in a weird spot as well and it pulls down at the armpit. Most tops of this type have a looser feel, but this shirt acts like it's supposed to be fitted for someone with a much larger shoulder.There's also a pretty substantial wasteband on the back of the shirt for what reason?? Backless shirts are usually comfortable and drapey. I like to throw them over sweatpants or dress them up with a cute little skirt and heels. But neither of those scenarios warrants a 2 inch thick hard piece of waistband on the back half of the shirt!I tried to figure out if I could shorten the sleeves, fix the shoulder, and remove the waistband that should have never been inserted into a shirt, and just gave up and returned it. The idea is great, but there are too many things wrong with the fit! It might work for a much taller person, but then I'd be worried that the draping wouldn't work with the giant unecessary waistband. Which might be more or an athletic fit and good for the gym, but you aren't doing anything practical with your fingers getting stuck in the way too long sleeves.","Reviewed in the United States on 3 April 2021","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

With that being said, the leotard was slightly big. However, not too big where the straps could fall down.  They are just lose. Hence, room for her to grow. If your child is 5, expect this to be slightly large.  The skirt is big too. Her waist is 20.5 cm. Because you can wrap the skirt around and there is plenty of wrap string it works!

The drawstring on these are fake 😂 I can look past it as it seems I won’t need them because they fit well right now but we will see. Also it does have the butt ruche-scrunch thing going on in the back I didn’t see when ordering it so if you don’t like that feature in athletic pants these aren’t for you.

I have been looking for decent mesh shorts for awhile like Champion made in the 90s.  I found these at a Hanes/Champion outlet store.  I am 32 waist, thick cyclist legs, tried a small on and I love it.  The inseam is 3"".  It seems that the listed women's sizing doesn't translate well to men's since the Medium a is tad big for me and according to the chart, I should be wearing a Large.  Now available on Amazon I purchased a few Smalls on sale.  The fabric is thinner than the men's version but that is not a big deal.

I normally wear an XL but due to the sizing chart I ordered the XXL and there a little too big and bulky. Definitely stick to your normal size. An XL would be a perfect fit. I can still wear them right now they fit just a little lose  but if I lose 5-10 pounds I will no longer be able to wear these.. I'm 5'6 and 195.

I plan on using them for sun bathing, lounging at home and quick errands so it's perfect for me. I feel like I could live in these shorts as there so comfortable.Update: I ordered these in pink the XL and the fit is much better but still comfortable. These are extremely stretchy... Again for reference  I'm 5'6 195 and the XL is a perfect fit but I could wear a large too. The elastic is extremely stretchy and workable..

"1761","AUTOMET Womens Sweatpants Comfy Drawstring Athletic Lounge Yoga Pants Workout Joggers Pants with Pockets","I love these pants!","Elyse","For reference, I am 5'1"" and 105-110 pounds. I have three pairs of these now, in both small and medium. I got the medium first and should have gotten the other two in medium as well.The small definitely fits, and they aren't uncomfortable. They just sit higher than I like (above my bellybutton), and that makes the pockets weirdly high on my hips. The legs aren't tight, and the length is good.The medium sits at my hips and the legs are nicely baggy but not overly so. They are a little longer, but since these are cuffed it isn't really an issue.So if you want a more fitted pant, get your normal size. If you want some bagginess, go a size up. Otherwise these are great. Super soft and comfy, great lounging around pants. Thin enough for warmer weather but not too thin to wear on colder days.

The green is a much lighter shade compared to the deep emerald depicted in the listing. Also, like some other reviewers, I'm not sure if they sent me the pink instead of purple, or if that's genuinely the color of the ""purple"" (but since these are just loungewear for home, I'm not really bothered). The grey blue is pretty spot on, though.Keep in mind that these DEFINITELY run small - I'm normally a medium/large-ish in USA women's (5'3"" and roughly ~150lbs), but I ordered these in XL and I feel like they fit appropriately (slightly baggy). I do have to roll up the bottoms 2 times, but that's super easy because of the elastic.All in all, if you're not too worried about the exact color, I think these are a great option for comfy lounge joggers.","Reviewed in the United States on 25 February 2024","2.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1824","NELEUS Women's Lightweight Running Shorts Workout Athletic Short for Yoga with Pocket","Great for tall people!","Jess B.","I purchased the 4"" inseam shorts. I'm 5'10"" and it's incredibly difficult to find women's workout shorts that aren't leggings and have an inseam greater than 2"", but are still shorts.I have heat and exercise induced urticaria (hives), so I can't wear tight fitting clothing, such a leggings, while exercising.These shorts are comfortable and breathable with deep pockets and adjustable draw string. The length is perfect.My only note about these is the sizing. I'm 5'10"" 145lbs. I bought a medium and they fit, but the waist band was a little snug and I didn't like how the scrunched band felt around my waist. For that reason, I sized up to a large. They have a little too much room in the waist but I'd much prefer to tie them closed than to feel like they are too tight. If you are sensitive to snug clothing, you may want to size up for the waist.Overall, these are my favorite workout shorts. The only change I would make to them would be zippered pockets.","Reviewed in the United States on 1 August 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They’re not overly flattering but I just wanted them for lounging around the house so that’s not a big deal. I plan to order more but I think I’ll order down a size.

The fabric is thick and not see-through (at least in the dark colours) and I feel so confident in it in the gym. Definitely go a size up from your usual size. Sizing was a little weird as bra was slightly too big but jacket is so tight on me that it pops open? But the leggings are super comfy. I have sensory issues and find that the bumpy fabric is uncomfortable if I wear it all day. However, just for the gym is fine. I've washed it several times and it hasn't lost its stretch or faded at all which is great. One thing - I got the one which I thought was black and khaki, but it's actually black with a fine lime green and black pinstripe pattern on the green bits, which makes it look khaki from a distance.

"1862","Veriliss 3pcs Gym Clothes for Women Tracksuit Womens Full Set Outfits Workout Joggers Yoga Sportswear Leggings and Stretch Sports Bra Jumpsuits Clothes Sets","Günstige Sportkleidung für kleine Größen ~~~ Affordable sports outfit for smaller sizes","TK","Das Set habe ich mir bereits vor einigen Monaten gekauft jedoch aufgrund zwischenzeitlicher leichter Gewichtsabnahme erst jetzt testen können. Zuvor saß es einfach zu stramm.Passform: Es ist zu merken, dass die Passform eher an kleine Größen angelehnt ist. Wer nicht komplett schmal gebaut ist kommt hier schnell an die eigenen Grenzen oder kommt einfach nicht in alle Einzelteile hinein. Das Bustier ist recht großzügig gearbeitet (bis Cup-Größe B/C). Darin sind seitlich herausnehmbare Schaumstoffeinlagen vorhanden sowie breite Träger sodass kein zusätzlicher Halt erforderlich ist.Die Kurz-Jacke gefällt mir sehr gut und kann alternativ mit anderer Freizeitkleidung wie z.B. Jeans kombiniert werden.Für die Hose ist wiederum eine schmale Körperform erforderlich. Die Streifen unter dem Po sitzen jedoch 10cm weiter unten als angedacht.Selbst die L-Größe wird oberhalb von 65 kg schon äußerst anschmiegsam es gilt also die Größentabelle dringend zu beachten und nicht nach der eigenen Standard-Kleidergröße zu gehen.Kompression: die Kleidung sitzt schon sehr eng am Körper gibt noch etwas nach beim Anziehen. Dafür wackelt nicht so viel und der Stützeffekt ist gegeben.Stoffqualität und Verarbeitung: Sicherlich muss man nicht groß über Nachhaltigkeit bei diesem Preis diskutieren. Dennoch ist ein Großteil konventioneller Sportkleidung aus Kunstfasern hergestellt. Der Vergleich mit ökologisch hergestellter Funktionskleidung ist demnach eher schwierig.Die Verarbeitung erscheint soweit solide jedoch habe ich die Teile per Hand und nicht in der Maschine vorgewaschen. Es ist vorstellbar, dass aufgrund der unterschiedlichen Stoffmuster und teils 3D-Struktur schnell Beschädigungen auftreten können. Insgesamt ist der Stoff dick (daher auch in der kühleren Jahreszeit draußen tragbar), dadurch schwitzt man eben auch etwas schneller.Farbe: Die Farbe hier Rosa/Lila ist wie erwartet und sieht sportlich-modern aus. Gefällt mir gut.Gesamteindruck: Aus meiner Sicht ist das Set eher für die jüngere Generation gedacht, teils auch noch mit 30-40 Jahren noch tragbar (je nach Farbwahl). Der Look ist sportlich aber wie gesagt muss eine gewisse Trainingsform/Fitness vorhanden sein sonst trägt es zu sehr auf und sieht seltsam aus.Für den Preis dennoch viel Ware für wenig Geld wobei eben nicht die nachhaltigste Wahl. Aufgrund der positiven Aspekte gebe ich 4 von 5 Sternen.~~~EnglishTo begin with: I bought the set a few months ago but couldn't wear it until recently due to slight weight loss. Before it was way too tight.Fit: It is to mention that the sizes relate to smaller sizes. When you're not completley slim you will easily have problems getting on the pieces or you won't fit into every single one of them. The bra is a little more spacious (up to cup B or C). Therein you find removable inlays made of foam. In addition the top has wide straps so you don't need additional support.The short jacket is very nice and can be combined with other sorts of causal clothing like jeans.In order to fit into the pants a slim body is recommended However, the stripes below the back are 5 inches lower than expected. Even the large size fits extremely tight above 65 kilogram so it is very important to take the size chart into account instead of choosing your own usual size.Compression: the clothes fit very tight to the body but is also stretchy while putting on. Therefore it is not too boundy and there is enough support, too.Quality and tailoring: Of course you can't discuss sustainability at this price point. Nonetheless the majority of conventional sports clothing is made of synthetic fibers.The comparision to ecologically fabricated functional clothing therefore is very difficult. The tailoring seems solid to me but I also pre-washed the pieces by hand and not in the washing machine. Maybe the tissue can be damaged easily due to the 3D-structure and the different patterns. In total the fabric is thick so you can wear it outside even during the cold seasons. Besides you also sweat more quickly.Colour: The colour pink/lilac is as expected and looks sporty and modern which I like very much.Overall impression: In my opinion the set is more suitable for the younger generation partly maybe also wearable in your 30s and 40s (depending on the colour choice). The look is athletic but you need to possess a certain form or fitness. Otherwise it comes out not too flattering and looks peculiar.Regarding the price you get a lot of product for your money while not picking the most sustainable choice. Due to the positive points I give the set 4 out of 5 stars.","Reviewed in Germany on 18 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The diverse choice of colors and patterns combined with the texture and fit makes these great.  I have never bought LR leggings but do have several active wear brands.  These are prettier and softer.  I am not a young woman so I was a little hesitant in wearing these outdoors.  That being said, as long as you wear a long enough top to cover your rear end I think it's totally doable.  I am retired and lead an a tive, casual life.  So many compliments have come my way!! I get the small size being 5'4 and 136 lbs.  Have already recommended Legging Depot to several women.

The material wicks moisture away from you quickly but is almost so good at it that it doesn't necessarily keep you warm (just a heads up!)

My immediate thought when taking it out of the bag was that it felt like great quality and the colors were true to the photos, very pretty. But I also noticed that it looked like an XXS. After double-checking the size, I was skeptical that it would fit, and it sure did not. I had already ordered a size up from my usual size M, and even the L I couldn't pull up past mid-calf and when I attempted to zip the top, the zipper would come right back down. It was almost comical. I know that different brands fit differently so teetering between two sizes is normal, but I am not sure how a size can be off this bad. It was disappointing to say the least.

"2008","C9 Champion Women's Full Zip Cardio Jacket","Love the jacket, I have two, but...","M. Waldschmidt","Great jacket - well fitted and a great cut that is longer in the back and not cropped (seriously, not everyone likes a cropped jacket - we sixty-year-olds actually DO go to the gym, lift, and run, but it doesn't mean we like everything skin-tight and cropped), but size up if you don't want the skin-tight fit. Great quality. The blue is beautiful.Had to take off stars because the first I ordered was perfect, but the second I ordered was in a sealed package, but smelled of perfume and the tags were cut out. OBVIOUSLY a worn and returned garment.

"2014","C9 Champion Women's Full Zip Cardio Jacket","Very nice but very fitted","volvomom","I had bought this jacket years ago at Target and I loved it. But I’ve lost a lot of weight and needed to replace it. I wear it on my walks when I need a lightweight jacket. This new version is much nicer. Thicker material, cut to be flattering. The back is a little longer which is nice to wear with workout leggings. The outside pockets have zippers but there are no inside pockets. This definitely runs small. I purchased a large according to their size chat and it’s small. I can zip it. But it’s tight. I would normally return for a larger size but since I’m still losing weight so I am keeping it.

"2017","C9 Champion Women's Full Zip Cardio Jacket","Fitting","Connie","My wingspan (fingertip-to-fingertip length) is an 1"" longer than my height. That kind of physiology is great for swimming or boxing, but it's terrible for wearing full-sleeve tops because regular-cut apparel will end above my wrist bone. It's like wearing ""flood-style pants"" on my arms.Thumbhole garments are an answer to this fit and fashion problem since the arm fabric is designed to be longer in order to encircle the thumb and upper part of the wrist and hand in a sort of half hand-glove fit. With my monkey-length arms, I still can't use the thumbholes without stretching the fabric, but worn as a regular garment, the sleeve length and wrist cuff lay long and flat - like proportional people's - right below my wrist. I also love the tapered waist, the zipped pockets, the high collar and the darts/accents just above the bosom. I bought two jackets - one in black and one in purple. They have become my go-to casual outfit.Now, if only I can find other casual and formal wear with this kind of design length, I'll be all set.","Reviewed in the United States on 13 March 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It ran very small - I wear a M in looser fit and a L normally but this large was like a sausage skin. The collar also stood up too high and hit my chin BUT if I wanted a workout or casual jacket like I said I would have exchanged for a size larger - it just wasnt what I wanted to leave in a casual office to wear when the AC was on too high.

"2020","C9 Champion Women's Full Zip Cardio Jacket","Nice jacket - runs a tad small","sunshinefisher1","Well made, no loose threads or problems with zippers and seams. I like the intermediate weight. The dark purple is a great color. Pockets deep enough for most phones. The sleeves are long enough to be comfortable working out or running. The back length is good - not too short, not too long - and comes to maybe 5"" or so below waist,  to keep out cold air. I like the thumb holes - keeps the sleeves where they should be. I can wear gloves without interference because they fit over the cuff. I took off one star because the cut seems a hair too tight in the armholes and across the bust. I am 5-6"", 143 lbs, average build.  The XL would be too big, and def too long in the arms. However, I still like the jacket. It is mid-weight and good for cool weather. A long-sleeved top makes it that tad too tight. If you do layer, the underlayer needs to be form-fitting or sleeveless.","Reviewed in the United States on 15 November 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I even got the same size as the original. Unfortunately, this item doesn't perform the layering function that I was expecting. It's very form-fitting, which would be fine if I could get a heavy T-shirt under it without leaving unflattering bulges. This works fine over a sports bra or maybe a thin (sleeveless) workout shirt. I could size up to a medium and be OK over a T-shirt, but I was really hoping for something that I could throw on as a jacket during cool (but not COLD temps). This jacket really isn't heavy enough for that. It's going back, and the search continues.

The jacket zips up over the neck, which I love because I like to cover my neck when running on cool, chilly days.  The arms are the perfect length for me, so the thumbholes are comfortably placed for me to slip into.  It comes down slightly over the butt, and I like that a lot.  It also washes well.

The back is a little longer so it covers a bit more. I have worn it as a jacket with weather in the mid 50s and it's just right. If exercising, I think it would be ok for slightly cooler temps. Arms are plenty long and fit well, and the pockets zip closed to keep your phone, keys, or whatever secure.

So I bought her three of the size Large, all of which were different widths, each a half inch smaller than the last.  So basically, of the three Large skirts, the biggest one fit the most comfortably, and I am now having to roll the dice and order a few more hoping there is another one that is made as close to that one she likes.  The rest I will have to keep returning.  Bottom line: Order a full size bigger than what you wear in Lulu.","Reviewed in the United States on 24 August 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2209","C9 Champion Women's Woven Training Pants","Not the Same Quality","sine cera","I've purchased, loved and worn the ""C9 Champion Womens Woven Training Track Pants"" for many years because of their durability, comfort and large mid-thigh front zip pocket. Originally, I bought these in several colors from another store, but Champion stopped selling them for 2 or 3 years. So I was delighted to search and find the same named pants here at Amazon. These latest pants I purchased (1) stank strongly of an unpleasant chemical when I opened their plastic bag; (it took 3 washes to eliminate this odor); (2) has a cheap zipper that I doubt will last very long with ordinary use; and (3) has a much thinner, less durable fabric construction that I accidentally poked a hole thru with my finger!! Lastly, the fabric is beginning to discolor, despite being cold washed gently with similar colors using Free and Clear, dried for just 10 minutes on Low and then hung to finish drying. Very sad ...

They did not dig into my belly due to having a flat waistband. There is no tag so I guessed the front down the back. They seem to not have a front. I can't believe how comfy there are. As another reviewer said they are not like Spanx. They're just a super comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States on 25 June 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
