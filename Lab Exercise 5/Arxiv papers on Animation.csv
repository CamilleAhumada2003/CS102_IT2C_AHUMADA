"1","holmes: holonym-meronym based semantic inspection for convolutional image classifiers","francesco dibitonto, fabio garcea, andré panisson, alan perotti, lia morra","computer vision and pattern recognition","convolutional neural networks (cnns) are nowadays the model of choice in computer vision, thanks to their ability to automatize the feature extraction process in visual tasks. however, the knowledge acquired during training is fully subsymbolic, and hence difficult to understand and explain to end users. in this paper, we propose a new technique called holmes (holonym-meronym based semantic inspection) that decomposes a label into a set of related concepts, and provides component-level explanations for an image classification model. specifically, holmes leverages ontologies, web scraping and transfer learning to automatically construct meronym (parts)-based detectors for a given holonym (class). then, it produces heatmaps at the meronym level and finally, by probing the holonym cnn with occluded images, it highlights the importance of each part on the classification output. compared to state-of-the-art saliency methods, holmes takes a step further and provides information about both where and what the holonym cnn is looking at, without relying on densely annotated datasets and without forcing concepts to be associated to single computational units. extensive experimental evaluation on different categories of objects (animals, tools and vehicles) shows the feasibility of our approach. on average, holmes explanations include at least two meronyms, and the ablation of a single meronym roughly halves the holonym model confidence. the resulting heatmaps were quantitatively evaluated using the deletion/insertion/preservation curves. all metrics were comparable to those achieved by gradcam, while offering the advantage of further decomposing the heatmap in human-understandable concepts, thus highlighting both the relevance of meronyms to object classification, as well as holmes ability to capture it. the code is available at this https url.",2024-03-13

"80","on the impact of biological risk in aquaculture valuation and decision making","christian-oliver ewald, kevin kamm","applications","this paper explores the impact of stochastic mortality and disease on animal-based commodities, with a specific emphasis on aquaculture, particularly in the context of salmon farming. the investigation delves into the stochastic nature of mortality and treatment plans based on historical data related to salmon lice. given that salmon lice pose a significant challenge in salmon farming, with associated treatment costs estimated to be comparable to feeding expenses, their removal is imperative to ensure the survival of the salmon and comply with the norwegian government's stipulation of maintaining 0.5 lice per fish.
we propose a new model that considers the relationship between hosts and parasites to estimate the number of treatments required and their overall cost. an important aspect of this model is its incorporation of stochastic effectiveness for each removal. after calibrating the model to the available data, the study examines the stochastic behavior's impact on the optimal harvesting decision in comparison to deterministic mortality models. the results indicate an approximate $1.5\,\%$ increase in the value of the salmon farm when employing the harvesting rule based on the stochastic host-parasite model as opposed to a deterministic model.",2024-01-24

"83","on computationally efficient multi-class calibration","parikshit gopalan, lunjia hu, guy n. rothblum","machine learning","consider a multi-class labelling problem, where the labels can take values in $[k]$, and a predictor predicts a distribution over the labels. in this work, we study the following foundational question: are there notions of multi-class calibration that give strong guarantees of meaningful predictions and can be achieved in time and sample complexities polynomial in $k$? prior notions of calibration exhibit a tradeoff between computational efficiency and expressivity: they either suffer from having sample complexity exponential in $k$, or needing to solve computationally intractable problems, or give rather weak guarantees.
our main contribution is a notion of calibration that achieves all these desiderata: we formulate a robust notion of projected smooth calibration for multi-class predictions, and give new recalibration algorithms for efficiently calibrating predictors under this definition with complexity polynomial in $k$. projected smooth calibration gives strong guarantees for all downstream decision makers who want to use the predictor for binary classification problems of the form: does the label belong to a subset $t \subseteq [k]$: e.g. is this an image of an animal? it ensures that the probabilities predicted by summing the probabilities assigned to labels in $t$ are close to some perfectly calibrated binary predictor for that task. we also show that natural strengthenings of our definition are computationally hard to achieve: they run into information theoretic barriers or computational intractability. underlying both our upper and lower bounds is a tight connection that we prove between multi-class calibration and the well-studied problem of agnostic learning in the (standard) binary prediction setting.",2024-02-12

in this paper, we examine a fundamental, well-studied social convention that underlies cooperation in both animal and human societies: dominance hierarchies.
we adapt the ethological theory of dominance hierarchies to artificial agents, borrowing the established terminology and definitions with as few amendments as possible. we demonstrate that populations of rl agents, operating without explicit programming or intrinsic rewards, can invent, learn, enforce, and transmit a dominance hierarchy to new populations. the dominance hierarchies that emerge have a similar structure to those studied in chickens, mice, fish, and other species.",2024-01-21
