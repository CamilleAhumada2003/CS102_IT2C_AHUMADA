Get it!","Allison .Mace","Love this set. Ordered a L. I'm 5""6, ~155 and a 34DDD.- Have it in army green and black. Probably going to get navy.- Can dress up or down.- Have worn shorts with another top and top with another skirt.- Its linen! Wore it to some hot day concerts and super comfy (Don't mind my to-go bev container haha).- Shorts are high waisted enough that you aren't showing your stomach unless you're really got your hands in the air, waving them like you just to don't care.Also, the Automet shorts style is the best. Ordered another seller to try in different color and wasn't a fan of the shorts. These are more tailored with a side zipper and elastic in back. Way more flattering.

I'm a small/medium in most things, and I got the medium in this and it was so cute! The top's hem came just to the waistline of the shorts and was nice and flowy, and the shorts were perfect and soft. Then I washed it and dried it. Now the top fits like a sports bra, and the shorts look like volleyball shorts. They didn't just shrink a little, they shrunk a lot! They aren't even in a condition that I would feel comfortable donating. So disappointing. Wish I could return or get a refund.

The zipper on the shorts failed on me and it got stuck in the top with the whole side opened.

I really love the shorts and they are super comfortable. My only issue is the zipper is a little weird and doesn’t zip easily at the seam but still works! The shirt isn’t super flattering on me, it makes me feel a bit boxy so I probably won’t wear the set together but I love both pieces (this is more of a me thing lol).

I have long legs so buying shorts before trying them on is always a risk but these were just long enough and fit well.When not compared to the image they provide, the set is actually very cute but I would advise going up a size.","Reviewed in Australia on 26 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I am 5’7, 175, I typically range from a M-L on sizing. I ordered a L in this set because some of the comments suggested it shrunk when drying. I washed mine, dried for a few minutes, then hung to try and it fits perfect!! The shorts are slightly big but super comfortable. I wanted longer shorts to wear in Disney, since I carry a majority of my weight in my legs/lower stomach. THESE WERE PERFECT. I would consider myself someone with larger thighs and the shorts did not ride up or leave me chafed after a full day in Epcot. The material is great and not see through. I was very comfortable all day. Great for anyone looking for something comfy they can move in!","Reviewed in the United States on 7 February 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It is so cute and flattering! I am 5’4” 115lbs and ordered the small for reference. The top is cropped but it shows just a hint of midriff because the shorts are high-waisted enough. It’ll be adorable with flat sandals or a wedge for just about any occasion.

"33","AUTOMET Womens 2 Piece Outfits Lounge Matching Sets Two Piece Linen Shorts Crop Tops 2023 Trendy Clothes Summer Vacation Set","Nice summer outfit","Naomi","I ordered the size that was most appropriate for my thick waist and the set was too big.  There is ample stretchy elastic in the back of the shorts such that they pull on easily and were generously sized at the waist.  The pleats on the front of the shorts are flattering and the top is boxy without being frumpy.  I am 5'5"", DD busty, and about a size 12 right now, and ordered the XL because I didn't want it too tight.  The armholes are way too big, and I need a size or two smaller.  Order your regular size on this.  Cute set!

It would’ve been the perfect size as-is, but I read the reviews about shrinking. So, I ordered the black in a size XL. I’m not at a place in my life (mom of young kids) where I can air dry things 😂 so I knew it would have to adapt to going through the washer and dryer. Not ideal, but I wanted to see if it could hold up.The photos with the black are post-drying. It shrunk to probably a medium! It’s shorter shorts and more cropped than I’d like, but it’s honestly fine.It seems like great quality. The waistband has a lot of give, even with the side zipper.  I’m small busted so the top works well for me.For the price, I’m pleased!","Reviewed in the United States on 25 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I got a M in this and I wish I could have gotten a large in the pants and a small in the top. The top's arm holes are pretty big which means my bra is visible under the arms. The pants (even though they stretch at the back singe) are still a little tight. I'm keeping it because neither of those things are bad enough to send back. The color is GORGEOUS. the material is nice. I would recommend this unless you're a very different size on top/bottom then I think it might be a hard to find the right fit/size.","Reviewed in Canada on 14 July 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I absolutely loved it. I really liked that since it was a 2-piece set I could wear the shirt with different bottoms and the bottoms with a different top. The top is true to size and has a comfortable amount of stretch. The shorts are the reason this didn't get 5 stars. The shorts close with a side zipper and don't have much stretch so it's a little difficult to close; however once you get them closed they are comfortable you just have to yank it a little bit first.","Reviewed in the United States on 10 March 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I first attempted to just zip it up but after I caught my side skin in the zipper I looked at it and held it away from my skin, ouch! had to hold down my breast to see zipper, not do that again. But to unzip it I had to look again to get it down little difficult, little frustrated. Thank goodness I did not have to urgently pee.

"60","AUROLA",NA,"Dianne Page","I've been on the hunt for the ideal pair of gym shorts, and I've finally found them with these women's gym shorts. These shorts have become an essential part of my workout wardrobe, and I can't say enough good things about them.First and foremost, these shorts are incredibly comfortable. The fabric is soft and stretchy, which makes them perfect for all types of workouts, from intense HIIT sessions to yoga and everything in between. They move with me, allowing for a full range of motion without any restrictions.One of the standout features for me is the moisture-wicking technology. I tend to work up a sweat during my workouts, and these shorts do an excellent job of keeping me dry and comfortable. I never have to worry about feeling sticky or uncomfortable, no matter how intense my workout gets.The fit is just right. These shorts are snug enough to stay in place during runs and squats but not so tight that they feel constricting. The waistband is comfortable and doesn't dig in, which is a huge plus. Plus, they come in various lengths and styles, so you can find the perfect fit for your body type and personal preference.I also appreciate the stylish design. These shorts look great both in the gym and for casual wear. The color options are trendy, and the quality is evident. Even after several washes, they still look as good as new.The durability of these shorts is impressive. They have held up well to frequent wear and washing, showing no signs of wear and tear. This longevity is a testament to their quality.In summary, these women's gym shorts are a fantastic addition to any workout wardrobe. They strike the perfect balance between comfort, performance, and style. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for shorts that can keep up with their active lifestyle. These shorts have truly become a game-changer in my fitness routine.","Reviewed in Australia on 23 June 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars",NA

"63","AUROLA","Great Quality and Fit","Emily Knecht","I’ve been looking for a good gym short that is flattering and fits comfortably and this is the best one hands down. The material is thick so you don’t have to worry about anything being see through. There’s no front seam which alleviates the concern about unflattering front appearance. The material is soft and smooth. The detail on the back is flattering and comfortable unlike some shorts I’ve tried that have way too much of a scrunch and the way it’s shaped is uncomfortable. Definitely worth the purchase and I’ve bought many.","Reviewed in Canada on 23 February 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"87","AUROLA","Awesome shorts.","Charlie","These are my favorite shorts that I own for leg workouts. They are very flattering, and the quality is top notch. I have a love-hate relationship with ""butt scrunch"" leggings... what I like about them is the practical aspect. This is going to sound weird lol, but its like each butt cheek is separately secured, so when you do squats, it doesn't feel like there is near as much stress being placed on the center-back seam of the material that goes over your butt. This also means that the material itself stretches less, meaning less chance of the material being see-through.I do NOT like butt scrunch leggings for the ""showing off your butt"" idea. I don't want that kind of attention when I go to the gym. This is precisely why I like these shorts as much as I do. They have the most discreet ""butt scrunch"" that I have tried. Enough to be practical and a little flattering, without giving off ""LOOK AT ME"" vibes. I would still only buy them in black, or a very dark color like navy, because the lighter/brighter colors would still have more of a show-off effect than what I am comfortable with.Some people are complaining about the length of the shorts. Yes, I agree that they are definitely longer than the picture makes them look, but I personally way prefer the biker short length. No rolling up or having to adjust anything mid-exercise.","Reviewed in Canada on 19 February 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"91","AUROLA","Not for thicc girls","TT","I wanted to love these sooo much! I like the feel of the fabric and it does give the glutes a nice lift but the band has a ton of compression and the main part of the bottom really doesn’t so it gave me some crazy hip dips. I have small dips but they’re usually not noticeable in most shorts and these just drew attention to them in the worst way. The uneven compression just caused everything to roll out of place as soon as I started moving. After 1 squat the shorts had given me so many new stomach rolls I could have opened a bakery. If you don’t have much to compress, they’ll probably be fine, if you’re curvy/muscular, you might look for something with more even compression all around.

"142","CRZ YOGA Women's Pima Cotton Workout Crop Top Short Sleeve Running T-Shirt Casual Athletic Tee ","Love it","Athena O'Neil","So if you’re anything like me, you hate returning things, ESPECIALLY if you bought something online. That is why I’m writing this review. I hope it can help someone. So I am 5’6, 175lbs, bust is 38. I got a medium and I’m so glad I did. I was debating on getting the large because on the size chart it said that a size 38 bust would fit better with a large but this is not true. I do not believe that this chart is accurate. It fit well and was not tight or baggy at all. I’ve seen a lot of other reviewers complain about how this shirt is too short, so I was initially very nervous to order because of this. I found that this shirt can be as short as you want it to be. If you wear high waisted leggings, no skin will be shown. If you wear low waisted leggings/pants, your stomach will show, but it is not excessive. It is just like a regular crop top, and it DEFINITELY goes past your bra (I saw a reviewer say that the top wouldn’t go past her bra). Unless you are exceptionally tall this shouldn’t be an issue. Also, if you lift your arms up to the ceiling, this shirt will rise up, but that is to be expected. This is a crop top. This is a GREAT top to wear to the gym and holds sweat very well. I’m overall very pleased with it, and this product has exceeded my expectations.Note: If you are inbetween sizes, stick with your normal size. If you want a tighter fit, size down. If you want a larger fit, size up.","Reviewed in the United States on 8 March 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The set consists a convenient 3/4 zip top and comfortable bottoms featuring an elastic waist and a drawstring.  I must admit the drawstring is more decorative than functional.  The wide leg of the pants is just right—not overly exaggerated but wide enough to provide a stylish and relaxed look.One of the amazing features is the softness of the fabric. I've washed this set three times already, and it still looks and feels as great as it did when I first got it. The color hasn't faded, and there's been no pilling or loss of softness.Being 5'4"" and 142 pounds, I opted for a medium, and it fits me perfectly. The only minor issue I encountered was that the pants were a tad long for my liking. However, a quick fix with hem tape resolved the problem, and now they're just right.  I initially purchased the navy blue set and was so impressed that I bought the apricot color a week later. I'm pleased to report that both colors are true to what's shown online.  The outfit is incredibly soft, and in my opinion, it's an excellent dupe for high-end brands.","Reviewed in the United States on 9 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Fabric feel is about same weight, it is very smooth but doesn't feel quite as luxurious to me.  Sizing/fit is interesting. The top feels gigantic for most part and the sleeves outrageously long. well past my finger tips. but the waist band feels tight and with less stretch. The matching pants are snug. the AE are ordered as separates and I probably would have sized up in the pants. they fit, but the look isn't super flattering due to the snugness particularly in the color I got.Speaking of, that was one of the things I loved was the color choices. the pink I got is definitely lovely.

Medium fits well and maybe even a smidge big. The pants, however, are long on me despite others saying they aren't long. I'm 5'4"" (that's generous) so I knew there was a risk. They also had a weird smell out of the package... I'm sensitive to smells so maybe it's just me? I washed them and hope this isn't a problem.","Reviewed in the United States on 8 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Material feels like that type that you can find in some athletic jackets...smooth & kind of slippery. It's not too thick and overall a soft comfy material. The thick high waisted band (about 2"") is a tighter elastic....it stretches, but it keeps everything in place. If you like the snatched-in look & feel you'll like it a lot. It has a drawstring that is stretchy and the aglet caps are metal which is nice. The zipper for the top is plastic...nothing fancy, but it does the job. I like that you can zip it all the way up to make it a loose mock turtleneck if you want. There is a small slit on each wrist cuff...not sure if this is so the wristband isn't too tight or it's suppose to be some kind of faux thumb hole lol. The arm & ankle lengths were just perfect.  I love the wide leg pants....not too wide & it falls nicely without bunching. I'm 5'7"" & ordered a medium....I think my measurements were in between med-large. I might order a large next time to see how it fits only because I like my waist band to fit looser (my waist is 33"").  Overall, I'm sure I'll wear this one lots as it's getting cooler outside.

In the photo, the dark cyan is a very dark teal.; but it is borderline electric blue in real life. It’s pretty, but it’s not a color I would choose to wear.Also, the scrunch on the butt is very dramatic. If that’s your thing, it’s really cute. If it’s not your thing, then stay away. I usually like a subtle scrunch so this shocked me at first to try on but I will admit that it grew on me…. I’ll just have to be brave enough to wear them because it draws a lot of attention to your butt!The sizing also surprised me. I usually wear an XS or smaller in bottoms. My waist is 22-23 inches and my hips are only about 34 inches so usually most clothes are too big on me but I sized up to a S and they are quite tight (but In a flattering way since they’re stretchy).

I had really high hopes for these shorts after seeing countless amazing reviews! Unfortunately, these did not sit right on my shape. They were too snug around my thighs and gaped slightly at the waist which made them slide down making them sit awkward on my shape. I could not go down a size as they would be too tight around my thighs and going a size up would make it even more loose around my waist… I am 5’7” and an AU size 8 for reference (more like an AU size 6 waist and AU size 10 hips).

They’re so comfortable they’re probably one of my top two pairs of workout shorts. The one thing I didnt like was the front seam has a tiny bit too much fabric and it puffs a bit which is mildly unflattering. But it’s not super noticeable, and the pros of these shorts outweigh that one con that I’m keeping these and wear them constantly. I did have to size up from a medium to a large to get the baggier/more relaxed look I was hoping for. There’s also a zippered pocket. Overall the quality of these is just so good. Even the sewn in undies are comfortable and I have always had to cut them out of my lululemon shorts. Can’t say enough good about this brand! Everything I buy keeps me excited and in love.

Not really, but it feels like it!My legs are by far the area I am most self conscious about so I’m very particular. I wanted to love the BMJL shorts that has so many reviews, but alas, it was not meant to be! They are comfy, but I didn’t love them. I would be settling. The medium fit my thighs but pinched the muffin! The large fit nicely on my hips, but the thigh holes were so big it added bulkiness…if there’s one thing I do not need, it’s bulkiness.Enter CRZ Yoga! I have several of their leggings and they are amazing!! I also have several sports bras and tank tops that I have had for YEARS and they are still in pretty good shape. That’s impressive since I workout 5 days a week! I have tried their shorts before (5 in inseam) and they were good, but the material was heavy (does that make sense), and I didn’t know that until I tried these. Also, the large in the older version was a tad bigger, but these fit like a dream! No muffin! Thigh holes are perfect (my thighs are 23 in around at the largest part)! The material is lightweight and quick drying. These are 3 in inseam, but I also have the 4 in inseam and you can hardly tell the difference. I like both a lot. My only complaint is they go fast, even on their website.Let me summarize this way, I got a color other than black or navy. That’s a huge win for me!

I’m 5’8” and don’t like really short shorts because I have this permanent hematoma on my upper outer thigh that I’m self conscious of and also don’t like it when short athletic shorts look like underwear when you sit down because they ride up. These still ride up when sitting but not nearly as much as others.The stretch is perfect. Enough to suck my tummy in some but not enough to feel uncomfortable on my abdomen. I have chronic GI pain that’s exacerbated by too tight of clothing. These don’t cause me issues! The built in undies fit almost perfectly. Sometimes the built ins are too small and cut into me but these are great.My only con is the pocket. I bought these shorts mainly because it has a pocket. I bought a pair of athletic shorts years ago with pockets and now I can never go back to no pockets! The 1 pocket on these does not fit my iPhone 10. I can stuff it in there but 1/3 of the phone sticks out so you definitely wouldn’t be able to run with your phone in there. It’s good for keys and a small travel pill container. If the pocket was slightly bigger then these would be a 10/10.Overall, these may be my favorite or in the top 2 favorite gym shorts that I own. I will probably buy more colors unless I can find others with better pockets.

"340","Gihuo Women's Athletic Full Zip Lightweight Workout Jacket with Thumb","Different Sellers","Damaris","BLACK SWEATER - ⭐️⭐️⭐️ I know it's cheap, but for $20 I could've gotten something really nice off of Old Navy. The material is extremely thin, and the finishing is terrible - loose threads, bad stitching etc. Also, the zipper is cheap and whoever sewed it didn't do it well enough because the fabric tends to create an odd buldge around my midriff that I can't press down. On another note, the fit is a bit off. I made sure to measure myself before buying but it is still too tight, and going up a size would make it too big for me. I have a somewhat long torso and this sweater tends to ride up a bit bc it is too cropped.WHITE SWEATER - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️obviously there are different sellers on this one Amazon post bc the white sweater is so much nicer than the black one. It has the perfect thickness for an exercise/lightweight jacket, the stitching is neat and the fit is absolutely perfect. The zipper is of good quality and there is no bunching along it. The feel of the material is also wonderful. The only downside is that it is a tad see through if you don't wear a black sports bra or t-shirt underneath.

I would definitely recommend it for those with more “proportional” whatever that means, bodies.","Reviewed in Canada on 12 February 2024","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"402","THE GYM PEOPLE Womens High Waisted Running Shorts Quick Dry Athletic Workout Shorts with Mesh Liner Zipper Pockets","Awesome and secure- a great dupe!","Sarah S","Detailed review ahead (girl, be ready for a novel)….I have to say first that I am a die hard lululemon fan, but I work as a choreographer every summer for a well respected theatre camp. Last year, all my lululemon running shorts and most of my tanks were on their last leg. I had heard about these online and wanted to give them a try as an alternative for summer camp, as I could spend less and buy more colors to mix and match. WOW! For the money you can’t go wrong.I purchased the white, black, denim blue, and jade green tanks and the matching mesh lined high waist running shorts. I am 5’7 and your typical smedium 32dd. I ordered medium across the board. I rapidly lose weight over the summer due to the heat and the exercise. I feel these will fit me if I fluctuate as low as about 15 pounds lighter.Tanks- These are fantastic. They are not for super high impact, but for lower/ medium impact dance they are great. I can also see myself wearing these all summer as loungewear or with shorts. If I sized down it would’ve given me more cleavage than I wanted.  I may try taking in the liner a bit for more security near the end of summer when I’ve dropped weight. Great lululemon dupe. Comfortable and flattering. The ONLY con I have is that the size varied slightly by color. The black and white fit more snug (which I preferred). The denim blue and Jade green fit a little looser as you can see in the side profile picture of the denim blue set.Shorts- these are great dupes as well! The back pocket completely fits my iPhone XR. The side pocket is super secure and deep. The shorts are slightly longer in the back. The high waist is pretty small and includes about an inch of tighter elastic. I personally like this for camp so my walkie doesn’t pull them down, but if you have more of a square figure it may pay to size up. The tank meets right where these shorts start. My only complaint on these is sometimes the way they lay can look a bit funky in the crotch area, but nothing too major. The colors all looked great. I wore the white with red underwear and it didn’t show through where the mesh liner was.As a set- Black is perfect and what you’d expect. The white is a CRISP white. Like, it made me pull out my teeth whitener white. It’s beautiful, but literally my Snow White OPI nail polish even looked a tad dingy in comparison. The Jade green shorts were a slightly different shade than the tank. It was not enough for my husband to notice without telling him. For some reason it looks a lot different in the photo but they’re more similar in person. The blue is a pretty darn close match. If anything, the band is slightly different due to the different material. It’s not a dealbreaker for me, as I plan to mix and match a lotFinal thoughts- I love them. I sent both my sisters the links to them, I will live in them all summer, and I will be buying more sets in a variety of colors.

"403","THE GYM PEOPLE Womens High Waisted Running Shorts Quick Dry Athletic Workout Shorts with Mesh Liner Zipper Pockets","I ordered a second pair the first day I wore these!","Sarah S","I bought these shorts for running. I got tired of my bike shorts riding up into unmentionable places while running and hiking! ;)Pros: Super comfortable. 2 pockets that work for keys and phone, the larger back pocket zips to keep your phone snug and safe. On point sizing. Stays exactly where they start, with nice loose legs for freedom of movement. Which brings me to my first con..Cons: Not a huge fan of the mesh attached underwear. Due to that I cut the mesh undies out, and found out that minus them, they do ride up a bit. They still give you decent coverage, but they didn't stay in place as much without them. I had to tug them down a few times over my 3 mile run. So. If you don't like the mesh briefs, just know that cutting them out means they don't stay out the same way. Also, the ruffle below the back waistband is a bit weird. It looks really flattering if you are wearing a crop or belly button length tank. It's not bulky under a longer or looser shirt, but..why? I don't really get the concept. I do miss side pockets a bit in these, but there IS pockets available for the necessities. So that might be picky on my part!Overall? I ordered more the first day I wore them, because they are cute and comfy! I got a ton of compliments and pointed a fellow yoga lover to them because the matching mesh briefs mean all the cheeks and bits stay decent. Even during a handstand!

"404","THE GYM PEOPLE Womens High Waisted Running Shorts Quick Dry Athletic Workout Shorts with Mesh Liner Zipper Pockets","The liner is looser and these are SHORT","quickcat","I am 5'2"", 140lbs generally a Large bottom. Got these in Medium Wine Red based on reviews and intending to wear them high waisted. They do feel a bit tight around my waist (34in), and they are SHORT worn like this... I cannot imagine a taller person or long legs!! Worn high-waisted these have about a 2in inseam, and it rolls up sometimes when I've been active a while which is really annoying.The back pocket is roomy for my phone (Samsung s10) to have a snug fit and doesn't feel like it flops around when I'm active. The front pocket is on the left side and suitable for a house key or room card or lip balm or something small.The mesh is light and these are light wicking. The liner is loose.... like quite loose. If I had a Large, I would have been swimming in it. So not great if you don't want to wear undies with these!The fabric is a sporty, lightweight fabric as expected and food for watersport as well as an alternative to swim bottoms. If they get wet (red wine color) it's noticeable from sweat or other liquids. The waist band is a softer stretch fabric and feels nice against the skin and nonchafing.These are very well made and high quality shorts. The color is a true wine red and very pretty.","Reviewed in the United States on 18 June 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Compared to other notable athletic brands, i think these are high quality for the price. The pictures aren't great to show the fit, but i wanted to show how vibrant the pink is. I LOOOOVE the color. I bought two different pairs both pink, but different shades of pink. This is the ""Bright Pink"" color. The other pair was ""Rose Red"". As some have mentioned, the waistband is pretty tight fitting. I dont mind it, but when I'm just wearing the shorts and my sports bra, it definitely cinches in at my waist, with just the slightest bit of skin bulging over. (the worlds tiniest muffin top) It doesn't bother me enough to not wear them. The other thing that makes the fit a little weird, is that while the waist is tight, the built in briefs are pretty dang loose. And i am not a pancake booty. I have some buns, and the briefs are loose on me. It causes the material where the shorts meet the waistband to give just a little puff thats not the most flattering. I'd rather it lay flatter than poofing out. Anyway, this could all be different with one size up. I'm 5'4"" 127lbs and bought size small. Maybe a medium would eliminate the issues, but c'est la vie.

"435","THE GYM PEOPLE Womens High Waisted Running Shorts Quick Dry Athletic Workout Shorts with Mesh Liner Zipper Pockets","Close....but not quiete a dupe","Amazonomaly","I am 5'6"", 130lbs, and a pant size 4 or 6. The fabric is not as soft as LuLu (of course) but still acceptable for a cheap version which I would take traveling abroad. As you can see in the picture, there is some puffiness where the flowy part of the short start which is not bad if you wear a shirt that hits that seam. What did it for me and why I am returning them is, the liner is SUPER BAGGY, to the point that I can fit 3 fingers width between the fabric and my leg = what is the point of it?","Reviewed in the United States on 5 September 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"438","THE GYM PEOPLE Womens High Waisted Running Shorts Quick Dry Athletic Workout Shorts with Mesh Liner Zipper Pockets","High quality, true to size","LM","I loved these so much I had to write a review.  I first purchased the pink shorts pictured above in medium because some reviewers said that these shorts ran small and since I wouldn't have time to exchange before an upcoming race I couldn't take a chance on them being too small.  They were a little billowy, but I kept them and loved the back pocket, which held my phone securely and the front pocket is great for a hotel key card or credit card.  I have washed and dried them and they seem very well made.  So I had to get another pair.  This time I got a size small, which is what I usually wear in most brands.  I also got a matching top in medium because I don't like to feel constricted.  I am 5-8 and 135 pounds, and athletic build.  I hope this helps people determine their size.  The top is also well made and the perfect length for me.  At 58 years old, I kind of like my crop tops a little longer.  ; )","Reviewed in the United States on 10 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"439","THE GYM PEOPLE Womens High Waisted Running Shorts Quick Dry Athletic Workout Shorts with Mesh Liner Zipper Pockets","Functional and nice but…","C. Witt","Wife purchased this because she is a runner and likes to be comfortable while she runs. It has a zippered pocket in the back to store essentials and the backside is a bit longer to cover her ample derrière. But… she says the back is maybe a bit too long. Noticeably longer than the front. I asked if it’s because her legs are short. So I am getting comfortable on the couch as I write this review. Sometimes our reviews just shouldn’t be too honest.","Reviewed in the United States on 31 August 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I think they're supposed to be like the Pace shorts. Several reviewers mentioned pockets large enough for an iPhone, but it just has the standard zip pocket in the back and little key/card slot in the front. Doesn't fit the smaller iPhone pro 13 in either. They aren't very stretchy so if you've got a big booty, it's going to pull weird in the front, similar to the pace shorts.
